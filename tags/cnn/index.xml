      <description>Convolutional neural network  As I am starting this CNN series of posts. I would like you to know about how neural networks work and then continue reading.
Convolutional Neural Networks are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other.</description>
